# Destiny Overview

Destiny is an app that takes your interests and current mood to recommend something to do at that time. For example, if you have
dogs as an interest and you state your current mood is "active" it might suggest Zilker Park. You only have to enter your 
interests once but mood can vary every time you use it.

Currently, Destiny has over 3,000 venues in it. It ranges from dog parks to dance clubs. Whatever mood you are in, Destiny can give you a recommendation.

More cities can be added to Destiny in the future. If you are interested in expansion, please let us know!

Coming to the app store December 2017!
